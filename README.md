# Fundamentals-of-Algorithms-offered-by-Peking-University
This is the fourth course of the specialization Fundamentals of Programming and Algorithms offered by Peking University on Coursera.

In particular, this course uses C++ for programming, and almost all the online resources use C++ for practice and exams. I did these practice and course assignments using Python, and posted these Python codes on Github to benefit the community.

The file names correspond to question numbers on PKU Onling Judge.
